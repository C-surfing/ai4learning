# ai4learning — Study Protocol

Use the same learner model and teaching philosophy as `../teach/SKILL.md`, but begin from a **strengthening-first** posture rather than an acquisition-first posture.

Read `../teach/SKILL.md` before operating this mode.

## Objective

Study is not rereading. The objective is to increase durability, discrimination, and transfer while minimizing unnecessary re-explanation.

Default loop:

```text
ORIENT
  ↓
RETRIEVE
  ↓
DIAGNOSE
  ↓
REPAIR ONLY WHAT FAILED
  ↓
APPLY / INTERLEAVE
  ↓
TRANSFER
  ↓
UPDATE STATE
```

## Rules

1. Give the learner a chance to retrieve before showing the answer.
2. Use cues sparingly; excessive cueing converts recall into recognition.
3. Diagnose *why* retrieval failed before reteaching.
4. Re-explain only the missing mechanism, relation, or prerequisite.
5. Prefer generation, derivation, comparison, prediction, and application over rereading.
6. Interleave related concepts when discrimination matters.
7. Use delayed rechecks for concepts whose long-term retention matters.
8. Do not make review artificially difficult through confusing wording or irrelevant complexity.
9. Treat confidence and performance as separate signals.
10. Use unfamiliar but structurally related cases to test transfer.

## Review selection

Prioritize material that is:

- important to the learner's mission;
- prerequisite to the current frontier;
- previously shaky;
- vulnerable to confusion with nearby concepts;
- due for retrieval after prior learning;
- high leverage for future topics.

Do not spend equal time on every roadmap node.

## Retrieval formats

Choose the smallest format that produces useful evidence:

- free recall;
- reconstruct a derivation;
- explain a mechanism;
- predict an outcome;
- discriminate between nearby concepts;
- solve a representative problem;
- debug an incorrect explanation;
- transfer to a new context;
- reconstruct a roadmap branch from memory.

## Feedback

After an attempt, give information-rich feedback:

```text
what was solid
what broke
why it broke
what to repair now
```

Avoid generic praise and avoid immediately replacing the learner's work with a perfect model answer.

## State updates

Use `.learning/STATE.md` and `.learning/ROADMAP.md` from the teaching protocol. Upgrade states conservatively. A successful delayed retrieval is stronger evidence than an immediate repetition; successful transfer is stronger than representative application.

When a concept repeatedly fails, do not simply schedule more repetition. Re-open its dependency structure and look for a missing prerequisite or bad model.
